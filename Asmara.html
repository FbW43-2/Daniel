    <h2>The Little Rome On The Horn Africa</h2>

    <P>
        Asmara was listed as a <B>UNESCO World Heritage Site in July 2017</B>, becoming the first modernist city anywhere to be listed in its entirety. The inscription taking place during the 41st World Heritage Committee Session.

The city has thousands of Art Deco, futurist, modernist, and rationalist buildings, constructed during the period of Italian Eritrea. The city, nicknamed "La piccola Roma" ("Little Rome"), is located over 2000 meters above sea level, and was an ideal spot for construction due to the relatively cool climate; architects used a combination of both Italian and local materials.

Some notable buildings include the Fiat Tagliero Building, opera houses, hotels, and cinemas, such as the Cinema Impero.

A statement from UNESCO read:

    It is an exceptional example of early modernist urbanism at the beginning of the 20th century and its application in an African context.
